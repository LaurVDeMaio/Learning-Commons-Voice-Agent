# Inworld Node.js Runtime SDK

The Inworld Runtime SDK is the first AI runtime built for consumer applications. Ship faster, automate operations, and experiment in real-time.

To learn more about how to use the SDK, check out our [Documentation](https://docs.inworld.ai/docs/introduction).

## Installation

You will need Node.js 18+ installed. You can use npm or yarn to install the SDK:

```bash
npm install @inworld/runtime
```

or

```bash
yarn add @inworld/runtime
```

## Starter Package
We recommend starting with downloading and extracting our [starter project](https://assets.inworld.ai/node-packages/getting-started-0.5.1.zip), which has the necessary package structure to get you up and running quickly.

After downloading the package, install the Runtime SDK and copy the .env-sample file to a .env and fill in your [Base64 Runtime API key](https://docs.inworld.ai/docs/node/authentication).

Then run the example with the following command:
```bash
npx ts-node index.ts
```

## Templates

Check out [templates](https://docs.inworld.ai/docs/node/templates/templates) that provide pre-built examples and starting points for common use cases with the Inworld Runtime SDK. Use them to help jumpstart your development with the Runtime SDK.
